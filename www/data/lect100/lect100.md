title: Creating an address
points: 10

Assume a fully associative cache with 4 lines. Each line holds 8 blocks.  Each block is 16-bytes.  Assume a 16-bit address.

\Q[3] How many bits are in each tag?  \short[2]{9}

\Q[3] Assume the cache has 4 sets and is 2-way set associative.  How many bits are in each tag? \short[2]{7}

\Q[1] How many bytes of data can be stored in the latter cache? \short[4]{1024}

\Q[3] Another question with some info.

\Q[1]{2} Some multiple choice question. 

\mc{A}{B}{!C}{9}

\Q[1]{2} And a true false to wrap it up. \tf{!True}{False}
