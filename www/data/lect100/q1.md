title: test question
points: 10
pass: 7

\Q This is a sample multipart question which would be presented to a
viewer of a video file.  They need to get pass number out of a total
number points to continue to the video.

\Q[5]{2} This is a sub question to the main question.  There might be some text about this question.  Is this a sub-question: \tf[1]{!Yes}{No}.

We can have more than one fill-in for each question.  Which fill in is this? \short[3]{/2(?:nd)?/i}[2]

How many fill-ins does this question have?

\mc[1]{1}{2}{!3}{4}{5}

\Q[5]{2} This is the second sub-part of this question. Here we have a
single long answer fill in.  Long answers generally require a human to
match them.  Not sure how we would use these while someone is watching
a video.  What is one way we could use long answer questions?

\long[3]{Maybe at the end of a video a human could grade them.}
